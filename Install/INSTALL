Installing this package can be a little trickier than others for
several reasons.  The package uses libxml, the XML parser that is
frequently found as part of the Gnome system but also exists as a
stand-alone library.  Many systems have a version of libxml installed,
but in some cases, we do not want to use that. By-passing the system
library, requires input from you, the installer/user. Also, there are
now two distribution series of libxml -- 1.8.* and 2.* that we
support.
 The possiblity of picking up the system header (include) files and
the wrong library, is complicated by the fact that these include files
are found in different locations depending on whether we are using an
installed on uninstalled version of libxml.  Oh, and yes, it can also
be compiled to use expat, the XML parser by Jim Clark. These different
possible combinations of these can make the installation and run-time
behaviour tricky. It is further complicated by the fact the package
works with both R and S-Plus 5 and S-Plus 6.  However, conceptually it
is not difficult. It is only the different number of possible
combinations that makes the logic complicated.


The package can be configured to use either or both of Daniel
Veillard's libxml library
(ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/stable/sources/libxml/) and Jim Clark's
expat (http://www.jclark.com/xml) library for parsing XML documents.
libxml is used for the tree-based (DOM) parsing and the event-driven
(SAX) parsing.  Expat is used only for the event-driven parsing and is
not necessary if one wishes to use libxml for both. The support for
expat is older and less well maintained since we adpoted libxml's SAX
parsing.


Note that the descriptions here are for Unix systems.  See
WindowsInstall for some details for Windows.


If you don't want to use the libxml2 series, then the default
installation should work without any additional work from you.
You can use the regular R installation command
  R INSTALL -c -l <directory/to/install> XML
or directly from the tar file
  R INSTALL -c -l <directory/to/install> XML_3.9-1.tar.gz

The -c (--clean) and -l (--library) flags are explained in the R
documentation (see ?INSTALL within R, the FAQ and the R-intro
documents in the distribution.)

One reason for defaulting to the older 1.8.* versions of libxml is
that some Gnome applications (e.g. Gnumeric) are compiled to use
that. When we embed R in Gnumeric and a user loads this XML package
into that embedded R session, there will be bizarre and silentaliases
and conflicts that cause severe problems.


Using libxml2
=============
If you want to use one of the libxml2 versions of the libxml
library, the simplest thing to do is to first
fully install that library and then specify the fully qualified
name of the xml2-config script to the configure script of this 
XML package.  One can do this by setting the environment
variable XML_CONFIG, e.g.
  setenv XML_CONFIG /home/me/XML/bin/xml2-config

Alternatively, one can specify the value on the command 
line of the R installation using 
 
   R CMD INSTALL --configure-args='--with-xml-config=/home/me/XML/bin/xml2-config'



Using a non-system version of libxml.
========================

If you want to use a version of libxml that is not installed in the
regular location in your system, you will need to tell the configuration
where to find the header files and the library. The simplest way to to 
do this is again to specify the location of the xml-config script,
be it xml-config or xml2-config, as explained in the section above.

Alternatively, if this is an older (read very old) version of libxml,
there may be no xml-config script. In that case, you can specify
values for the environment variables that are used when compiling the
C code and linking the object code.  Do this before invoking the R
INSTALL command.

The envirnment variable LIBXML_INCDIR is used to specify the location
of any compilation flags needed to compile libxml source code.  It is
is typically used to specify the directives to find include/header
files.  Directories specified here should now be prefixed with a
-I, e.g.

  setenv LIBXML_INCDIR="-I/home/me/include/gnome-xml"

One can also add pre-processor defines using -Dsymbol=value.

In order to specify the location of the libxml library for linking
purposes, one sets the environment variable LIBXML_LIBDIR.  Again,
this should now have a -L preceeding the directory names.

  setenv LIBXML_LIBDIR="-L/home/me/lib/gnome-xml"


Typically, one sets these environment variables to the include/ and
the .libs/ directory within the libxml distribution, respectively.
For example, whe I install using version libxml2-2.2.12 which I have
in my ~/XML/ directory, I set these to

  LIBXML_INCDIR  ~/XML/libxml2-2.2.12/include
and
  LIBXML_LIBDIR  ~/XML/libxml2-2.2.12/.libs

Then, run 
  R INSTALL -c -l <whereve> XML
and it should tell you where it is finding the include files.
However, using the xml-config or xml2-config script is very much
simpler.
