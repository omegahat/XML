\title{Class to describe a reference to an XML DTD}
\description{This class is intended to identify a DTD by SYSTEM file and/or PUBLIC 
  catalog identifier.  This is used in the DOCTYPE element of an XML document.}
\section{Objects from the Class}{
  Objects can be created by calls to the constructor function \code{\link{Doctype}}.
}
\section{Slots}{
  \describe{
    \item{\code{name}:}{Object of class \code{"character"}. This is the name of the 
      top-level element in the XML document.}
    \item{\code{system}:}{Object of class \code{"character"}. This is the name of the file on the
       system where the DTD document can be found. Can this be a URI?}
    \item{\code{public}:}{Object of class \code{"character"}. This gives the PUBLIC 
    identifier for the DTD that can be searched for in a catalog, for example to map the
    DTD reference to a local system element.}
  }
}
\section{Methods}{
  There is a constructor function
  and also methods for \code{\link{coerce}} to convert an object
  of this class to a character.
