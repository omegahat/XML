Version 3.98-1
  
  *      Compilation error with clang. Simple declaration of a routine.

Version 3.98-0

  *      Update for libxml2-2.9.1 and reading from a connection for xmlEventParse().

  *      xmlIncludes() is a hierarchical version of getXIncludes()

  *      Modifications to xmlSource(), e.g. verbose = TRUE as default.

Version 3.97-0

  *      Fix for xmlValue(node) = text.  Identified by Lawrence Edwards.
         Uses xmlNodeSetContent() now and leaves freeing the original content to that routine.

  *      Updates for xmlSource()

Version 3.96-1
 
  *     readHTMLTable() ignores headers that are over 999 characters.

  *     Fix a problem in readHTMLTable() with some table headers not having 
        the correct number of elements to match the columns.
  
Version 3.96-0

  *     Introduced readHTMLList(), getHTMLLinks(), getHTMLExternalFiles(), getXIncludes().

  *     When serializing XMLNode objects, i.e. R representations of nodes, ensure " and <, etc. in attributes
        are serialized correctly.


Version 3.95-1

  *     Allow htmlParse(), xmlParse(), etc. ?

Version 3.95-0

  *     Moved development version of the source code for the package to github -
        https://github.com/omegahat/XML.git

  *     Changes to the structure of the package to allow installation directly rather than
        via a one-step staging into the R package structure.

  *     Sample XML documents moved from data/ to exampleData, and examples updated.

  *     getDefaultNamespace() and matchNamespaces() use simplify = TRUE to call
        xmlNamespaceDefinitions() to get the namespaces as a character vector rather than
        list.

  *     Documentation updates
 

Version 3.94-0

  *     getNodeLocation() now reports the actual line number for text nodes rather than 0,
        using the sibling nodes' or parent node's line number. 

  *     xpathApply() and related functions work with builtin type "functions", 
        e.g. class.

  *     xpathApply() and related functions (getNodeSet, xpathSApply) allow
        the caller to specify multiple queries as a character vector
        and these are pasted together as compound location paths by
        separating them with a '|'.  This makes it easier for the
        caller to manage the different queries.

  *     assigning to a child of a node works, e.g. node[["abc"]] = text/node
        and node[[index]] = text/node.  We replace a matching name.  If the
        replacement value is text, we use the name to 

  *     getChildrenStrings() is a function that implements the equivalent of
        xmlApply(node, xmlValue) but faster because we avoid the function call
        for each element.

  *     options parameter for xmlParse() and htmlParse() for controlling the parser.
        (Currently only used when encoding is explicitly specified.)

  *     encoding parameter for xmlParse() and xmlTreeParse() now works for XML documents,
        not just HTML documents.

  *     Update for readHTMLTable() method so that we look at just the final <tr> node 
        in a <thead>.

Version 3.93-1

  *     Fixed bug in findXInclude() that sometimes got the wrong XMLXIncludeStartNode.
        Hence getNodeLocation() might report the wrong file, but correct line number!

  *     findXInclude() now has a recursive parameter that resolves the chain of XIncludes.
        This returns the full path to the file, relative to the base/top-level document,
        not just the parent document.

  *     Change to the default value of the error parameter in htmlParse() and htmlTreeParse() 
        which will generate a structured R error if there is an IO error.
        The set of issues that will raise an error will be broadened in the future.

Version 3.93-0

  *    Enabled the fixing of <dummy> namespaces by finding the definition o
       for that prefix in the ancestor nodes. 

Version 3.92-2

  *    Synchronized compilation flags for Windows with those on OSX & Linux.

Version 3.92-1

  *    Restore original error handler function for htmlParse() and htmlTreeParse()

  *    Fixed a reference counting problem caused by not adding a finalizer in the
       as() method for coercing an XMLInternalNode to an XMLInternalDocument.
       Example from Janko Thyson.

  *    Fixed up some partial argument names found by R CMD check!


Version 3.92-0

  *    Added --enable-xml-debug option for the configure script and this activates
       the debugging diagnostic reporting, mainly for the garbage collection and node
       reference counts.

  *    Work-around for HTML documents not being freed (but XML documents are!)

  *    Added an isHTML parameter for xmlTreeParse.

  *    Merge htmlTreeParse/htmlParse with xmlTreeParse.

  *    Implemented some diagnostic facilities to determine if an external pointer
       is in R's weak references list.   This needs support within R. (Ask for code if 
       you want.)

Version 3.91-0

  *    Start of implementation to allow nested calls to newXMLNode() to use namespace prefixes
       defined in ancestor nodes.  Disabled at present.

Version 3.9-4

  *    readHTMLTable() passes the encoding to the cell function.

  *    xmlValue() and saveXML() use the encoding from the document, improving conversion of strings.

  *    More methods for getEncoding()

Version 3.9-3

  *    getEncoding() returns NA when the encoding is not known.  Previously, this might seg-fault!

  *    readHTMLTable() passes an encoding argument to the call to xmlValue (and the value of elFun).

Version 3.9-2

  *    Static NAMESPACE (rather than generated via configure)

  *    Default for directory in Makevars.win to search for header files and libraries needed
       for compilation.

Version 3.9-1

  *     Added method for removeNodes for XMLNodeList.

Version 3.9-0

  *     Enabled additional encoding for element, attribute and namespace names, and 
        in xmlValue().

  *     Corrected default value in documentation for parse in xmlSource().

Version 3.8-1

  *     Corrected documentation for readHTMLTable() about stringsAsFactors behaviour.

  *     Added parse = FALSE as parameter for xmlSource() to allow just returning the text from 
        each node.

Version 3.8-0

  *     added readSolrDoc() and readKeyValueDB() functions to read Solr and Property list documents.

Version 3.7-4

  *    saveXML() for XMLNode returns a character vector of length 1, i.e. a single string.

Version 3.7-3

  *    Allow xmlTreeParse() and xmlParse() to process content starting with a BOM.
       This works when the name of a file/URL is provided, but didn't when the content
       was provided directly as a string.  Identified by Milan Bouchet-Valat.

  *    error message when XML content is not XML or a file name now puts the content at the end
       for improved readability. 

Version 3.7-2

  *    Import methods package explicitly.

Version 3.7-1

  *    Added an alias for the coerce method for Currency.

  *    Added a C routine to query if reference counting is enabled.
       See tests/checkRefCounts.R.

Version 3.7-0

  *    Added Currency as an option for colClass in readHTMLTable to
       convert strings of the form $xxx,yyy,zzz, i.e. comma-separated
       and preceeded by a $.  (No other currency supported yet.)

  *    Fix for newXMLNode() that caused a seg fault if a node was specified 
       as the document.  Thanks to Jeff Allen.

Version 3.6-2

  *    Changed URL in readHTMLTable() example to new page for population of 
       countries

  *    Changes to Rprintf() rather than stderr. Still some code that uses stderr
       intentionally.

Version 3.6-1

  *    Fix bug which caused XMLInternalUnknownNode in xmlParent() for HTML documents.

  *    General improvements to support nodes of type XML_HTML_DOCUMENT_NODE.

  *    removeNodes() method for XMLNodeSet.

Version 3.6-0

  *    xmlParent() is an S4 generic with methods.

  *    xmlAncestors() has a count argument to limit the number of ancestors
       returned.

  *    removeNodes() is generic.

  *    addChildren() now removes "internal" nodes from their current parent, if any.
       Avoids memory corruption in XML tree.

  *    ADD_XMLOUTPUT_BUFFER R variable for Windows.

  *    Defined XMLTreeNode as an old-style class.

Version 3.5-1

  *    Additional workaround for libxml2 2.6.16 for printing HTML document.
  
  *    noMatchOk parameter for xpathApply.XMLInternalNode to suppress warnings about 
       finding no nodes when there is a namespace in the query.

  *    xmlNamespace<-() function and methods to allow one to set the namespace
       on a node, e.g., by the namespace prefix.

  *    readHTMLTable() allows "factor" as an entry in colClasses.


Version 3.5-0

  *    Addeds nsDef parameter for parseXMLAndAdd().

  *    Minor addition to readHTMLTable() methods to handle malformed HTML 
       with all the tr nodes in the thead. 

Version 3.4-3

  *    Set default of append parameter in xmlChildren<-() method for non-internal nodes
       to FALSE so that we replace the existing nodes.

Version 3.4-2

Version 3.4-1
   
  *    Type in C code for method for xmlClone().

  *    Minor fixes for formatting of 2 help/Rd files.

  *    Removed definition of XPathNodeSet which is never used here but redefined in Sxslt.

  *    Fix when adding a default namespace to a node in an HTML document.

  *    Fix when adding a default namespace to a node in an HTML document.

Version 3.4-0

  *    Added xmlSearchNs() to aid looking for XML definitions by URL or prefix.

  *    Support in readHTMLTable() for identifying values formatted as percents 
       or numbers with commas. Use the classes FormattedInteger, FormattedNumber
       and Percent in colClasses.

Version 3.3-2

  *    Better handling of namespace definitions and uses in newXMLNode
       and separation of internal code into a separate function.

Version 3.3-1

  *    Configuration to conditionally compile code and export functions
       for removing finalizers.  This relies on C routines tha will be 
       added to the base R distribution, so not present in any released 
       version of R as yet.

Version 3.3-0

  *    addFinalizer added as parameter to many functions and methods that 
       can return a reference to an internal/C-level node.  This controls
       whether a finalizer is added to the node and reference counting
       is performed.  See MemoryManagement.pdf/.html for more details.

  *    One can set the suppressXMLNamespaceWarning as either an XML option (via setOption())
       or as a regular R option (via options(suppressXMLNamespaceWarning = ...)  )

  *    Added methods for docName() for XMLHashTreeNode and XMLNode.

  *    added docName when converting from an internal tree to an XMLHashTree.

  *    xmlHashTree() uses an environment with no parent environment, by default.

  *    Added an append parameter to addChildren().

  *    Fixed coercion from XMLInternalNode to XMLNode.

  *    Made the methods (e.g. xmlAttrs<-(), xmlParent(), ...) 
       for XMLNode and XMLInternalNode consistent.

  *    Made classes agree for xmlParse() and newXMLDoc()

  *    fixed corner/end cases for getSibling for XMLHashTreeNode

  *    Added xmlRoot<- methods for XMLInternalDocument and XMLHashTree.

  *    Minor enhancement to xmlToDataFrame() so that one can pass
       the value from getNodeSet() directly as the first argument to xmlToDataFrame()
       without passing it via the nodes parameter.

  *    Registered all of the native routines being invoked via .Call().

Version 3.2-1

  *    Turn reference counting on by default again.

Version 3.2-0

  *    Change to reference to normalizePath() which was moved from utils to base in R-devel/R-2.13

Version 3.1-1

  *   Minor change in readHTMLTable method to identify table header better.

Version 3.1-0

  *   Method for [[ for internal element nodes that is much faster (by avoiding
      creating the list of children and then indexing that R list). 
      Thanks to Stavros Mackracis for raising the issue.

Version 3.0-0

  *   This is not a major release, but an incremental numbering from 2.9-0 to 3.0-0, but with
      one potentially significant change related to creating nodes.  newXMLNode() now uses
      the namespace of the parent node if the namespace argument is not specified.

  *   Refinments to improve the garbage counting and referencing counting on internal nodes.


Version 2.9-0

  *   xmlAttrs(, TRUE) for internal nodes returns the URL of each namespace definition
      in the names of the attr(, "namespaces") vector.

  *   Added parseXMLAndAdd() to parse XML from a string text and 
      add the nodes to a parent node.  This facilitates creating
      a large number of quite regular nodes using string processing
      techniques (e.g. sprintf(), paste())

  *   xmlEventParse() with branches now has garbage collecting activated.

Version 2.8-1

  *   Filled in missing documentation

  *   Added missing init = TRUE for the parameters in one of the methods for xmlSource().

Version 2.8-0

  *   xmlClone() puts the original S3 classes on the new object.

  *   Trivial fix to readHTMLTable() to get the header when the table header is inside
      a tbody.

  *   Garbage collection/Memory management re-enabled.
 
Version 2.7-0
 
  *   compareXMLDocs() function

  *   Added xmlSourceFunctions() and xmlSourceSection()
  
  *   Support in saveXML() for XMLInternalDocument for the prefix parameter.

  *   saveXML() and related methods can deal with NULL pointers in 
      XMLInternalDocument objects.

  *   fixed bug in catalogAdd().

  *   docName() made an S4 generic with S4 methods (rather than S3 methods).

  *   added catalogDump()

  *   readHTMLTable() puts sensible names on the data frames if there is no header for the table.


Version 2.6-0

  *   When copying a node from one document to another, the node is explicitly
      copied and not removed from the original document. This also fixes a problem
      with the name space not being on the resulting node.

  *   New functions for converting simple, shallow XML structure to an R data frame.
      xmlToDataFrame() & xmlToList()

  *   addChildren() can handle _copying_ a node from a different document.

  *   as()/coerce() method for URI to character.

  *   New functions to convert an XML tree to an S4 object and also to infer
      S4 class definitions from XML. (makeClassTemplate(), xmlToS4())

  *   Minor change to C code for compilation on Solaris and Sun Studio

Version 2.5-3

  *   Trivial change to an Rd file to add an omitted 

Version 2.5-2
 
  *   Configuration enhanced to handle very old (but standard on OS X) versions of libxml which do not have 
      the xmlHasFeature() routine.
      People with such an old version of libxml (i.e. 2.6.16) should consider upgrading. That is 5 years old.

Version 2.5-1

  *   Added a configuration check and compile time condition for the presence of XML_WITH_ZLIB.  This
      allows installation with older versions of libxml2 such as 2.6.26.

  *   Moved some old S3 classes to S4 class definitions to deal with recent changes to the methods package.

Version 2.5-0

  *   Added xmlParseDoc() and parser option constants. These allow one to parse a document
      from a file, URL or string and specify any combination of 20 different options controlling
      the parser, e.g. whether to replace entities, perform XInclude, add start and end XInclude nodes,
      expand entities, load external DTDs, recover when there are errors.

  *   Added libxmlFeatures() to dynamically determine which features were compiled into the version
      of libxml2.

  *   newXMLNode() has a new argument sibling which is used to add the new node as the sibling of this
      node.  The parametr 'at' is used as the value for the 'after' parameter in addSibling().

  *   saveXML() is now an S4 generic. (Changes in other packages, e.g. Sxslt, RXMLHelp.)

  *   Added readHTMLTable() which is a reasonably robust and flexible way to read HTML tables.

  *   Added runTime parameter for libxmlVersion() so we can get compile and run time version information.


Version 2.4-0

  *   Significant change to garbage collection facilities for internal/C-level nodes.
      This works hard to ensure that XMLInternalDocument objects and XMLInternalNode objects
      in R remain valid even when their "parent" container is released in R. See memory.pdf.
      This can be disabled with configuration argument --enable-nodegc=no.

  *   Configuration option to compile with xmlsec1 (or xmlsec1-openssl).  More to come on support for this.

Version 2.3-0

  *   Added getLineNumber() to be able to determine the line number of an XML node within 
      its original document.

  *   xmlApply() and xmlSApply() have a parameter to ignore the XInclude start and end nodes.

  *   xmlChildren() also have an omitNodeTypes parameter and by default exclude XInclude nodes.

  *   Added ensureNamespace() to add a namespace definition(s) if necessary.

Version 2.2-1

  *   source() method equivalent to xmlSource() and appropriate installation 
      changes for older versions of R ( < 2.8.0).

Version 2.2-0
  *   Added xmlClone() and findXInclude() functions.

  *   [Important] Bug fix regarding the error handling function for XML and HTML parsing.
      Uncovered by Roger Koenker.   This manifested itself in R errors of the form
      "attempt to apply non-function".

Version 1.99-1
  
  *   addChildren() unconditionally unlinks nodes that already have a parent.

  *   Typo bug in removeChildren.XMLNode code found and fixed by Kate Mullen.

Version 1.99-0

  *   Added recursive parameter to xmlValue() function to control whether to work on just the 
      immediate nodes or also children.
 
  *   Correction for xpathSApply() when returning an array/matrix which referred to a non-existent variable.

  *   Faster creation of internal nodes via newXMLNode().

  *   xmlRoot() for XMLHashTree works for empty trees.

  *   Added xmlValue<-() function.

  *   Fix for removeAttributes() with namespaces.

  *   Addition to configure script of the argument --with-xml-output-buffer to force 
      whether to compile and use our own "local" version of xmlOutputBufferCreateBuffer()
      which is needed on unusual systems.  Supplied by Jim Bullard (UC Berkeley).


Version 1.98-1
 
  *   Deal with older S3-style classes with inheritance for 2.7.2 differently from the 2.8.0 
      mechanism.

  *   Changes to catch more cases of xmlChar * being treated as char * which causes the Sun compiler to 
      fail to compile DocParse.c

  *   Export class XMLNamespaceDefinitions which caused problems in the code in the caMassClass package.


Version 1.98-0

  *  The function XML:::xpathSubNodeApply() is the implementation of xpathApply() for an XMLInternalNode
     from earlier versions of the package and which explicitly moves the node to a new document and performs
     the XPath query and then re-parents the node.  Instead of using this, users can use xpathApply()/getNodeSet()
     and simply change the XPath expression to be prefixed with ., e.g. instead of //tr, use .//tr to root the 
     XPath query at the current node.

  *  Minor patch to configure.in to allow for libxml2-2.7.*.
 
  *  saveXML() for XMLInternalDocument now uses xmlDocFormatDump() ratehr than xmlSaveFile()
     and so formatting is "better".

  *  The [ and [[ operators for XMLInternalDocument support a 'namespaces' parameter
     for ease of extracting nodes. This is syntactic sugar for getNodeSet()/xpathApply().

  *  xmlParse() and htmlParse() return internal documents and nodes by default and are easier to type.
     The results are amenable to XPath queries and so these are the most flexible representations.

  *  xmlRoot() has a skip argument that controls whether to ignore comment and DTD nodes.
     The default is TRUE.

  *  Additional functionality for XMLHashTree and XMLHashTreeNode, including facilities for creating nodes
     while adding them to the tree, copying sub-trees/nodes to separate trees.

  *  Functionality to convert from an XMLInternalNode to an XMLHashTree - as(node, "XMLHashTree").
     This is also an option in xmlTreeParse(, useHashTree = TRUE/FALSE)
     [or xmlTreeParse(, treeType = "hashTree")]

  *  Branch nodes from xmlEventParse(, branches = list(...)) are now garbage collected appropriately.

  *  xmlAttrs.XMLInternalNode now does not add the namespace prefix to the name of the attribute, 
     by default. Use xmlAttrs(node, addNamespace = TRUE) to get old behaviour.

  *  xmlGetAttr() has a corresponding new parameter addNamespace that is passed through to the call to 
     xmlGetAttr().

  *  getRelativeURL() function available for getting URI of a document from a given attribute
     relative to a base URL, e.g. an HTML <a href=""/> or a <schema:import schemaLocation=""/>.

  *  xmlAttrs<- methods support an append (TRUE by default) to add values to the existing attributes,
     or to replace the existing ones with the right-hand side of the assignment.

  *  xmlAttrs<- checks for namespaces in all the ancestors for XMLInternalNode and XMLHashTreeNode.

  *  Introduced the class XMLAbstractNode which is the parent for the XMLNode, XMLInternalNode and 
     XMLHashTreeNode, which allows high-level methods that use the API to access the elements of the nodes
     to be defined for a single type.

  *  Changed name of XMLNameSpace class to XMLNamespace (lower-case 's').

Version 1.97-1

  *  Fix for configuration in detecting existence of encoding
     enumerations in R.  So now encoding of strings is working again.
  

Version 1.97-0

  *  Added xmlNativeTreeParse() as an alias for xmlInternalTreeParse()
     and xmlTreeParse(, useInternalNodes = TRUE).

  *  Assignment to attributes of an R-level XML node works again, e.g.
          xmlAttrs(doc[[3]][[2]])['foo'] = "bar"

  *  Subsetting ([[) for XMLHashNode behaves correctly.

  *  Added .children parameter to addTag() function in xmlOutputDOM() objects.
   
  *  Thanks to Michael Lawrence, a significantly simpler and more
     general  mechanism is used for getNodeSet()/xpathApply() when
     applied to a node and not a document.  This allows xpath queries
     that go back up the ancestor path for the node.


Version 1.96-0

  *  Functionality for working with XML Schema now incorporated.

  *  xmlSchemaValidate() function for validating a document against a schema.

  *  xmlSchemaValidate() using structured error handlers to give
     information about line numbers, columns, domain, etc. as well as
     the message.

  *  xmlChildren() method for XMLInternalDocument

  *  Recognize additional internal node types,
     e.g. XMLXIncludeStartNode, ...

  *  foo.dtd example now uses internal and external entities for illustration.


Version 1.95-3

  *  configuration change to support older versions of R that do not
     have the C enumeration type cetype_t defined in Rinternals.h.

Version 1.95-2

  * Fix for xpathApply()/getNodeSet() on the top-level node of a document
    which left the original document with no children!  Found by Martin Morgan.

Version 1.95-1

  *  Minor bug fixes regarding Encoding issues introduce in 1.95-0.

  *  xmlEventParse() calls R_CheckUserInterrupt() when making callbacks to R functions
     and so should make the GUI more responsive.

  *  Test for older versions of libxml2 which did not have a context field in the xmlNs
     data structure.

Version 1.95-0

  *  Use the encoding of the document in creating R character strings to identify 
     the Encoding() in R. There are probably omissions and potential problems, so 
     I would be very grateful for examples which fail, along with the file, the locale
     and the R code used to manipulate these.


Version 1.94-0

  *  Fixed a bug in xpathApply()/getNodeSet() applied to an XMLInternalNode
     which now ensures that the nodes emerge with the original internal document
     as their top-level document.

  *  Added processXInclude() for processing individual XInclude nodes
     and determining what nodes they add.

  * If asText is TRUE in xmlTreeParse(), xmlInternalTreeParse(), ...,
     no call to file.exists() is made. This is both sensible and
     overcomes a potential file name length limitation (at least on
     Windows).

  *  The trim parameter for xmlInternalTreeParse() and
     xmlTreeParse(, useInternal = TRUE) causes simple text nodes
     containing blank space to be discarded.  saveXML() will, by
     default, put them back but not if text nodes are explicitly added.

  *  xmlTreeParse(), xmlInternalTreeParse(), htmlTreeParser(),
     parseDTD(), etc.  take an error handler function which defaults to
     collecting all the errors and reporting them at the end of the
     attempt to parse.

  *  getXMLErrors() returns a list of errors from the XML/HTML parser
     for help in correcting documents.

  *  Added xmlStopParser() which can be used to terminate a parser from
     R. This is useful in handler functions for SAX-style parsing via
     xmlEventParse(). 

  *  A handler function passed to xmlEventParse() can indicate that it
     wants to be passed a reference to the internal xmlParserContext by 
     having the class XMLParserContextFunction.  Such functions will be
     called with the context object as the first argument and the usual
     arguments displaced by 1, e.g. the name and attributes for a
     startElement handler would then be in positions 2 and 3.
   
  *  When parsing with useInternalNodes= TRUE and trim = TRUE in
     xmlTreeParse() or xmlInternalTreeParse(), blank nodes are discarded
     so line breaks between nodes are not returned as part of the tree.
     This makes pretty-printing/indenting work on the resulting
     document but does not return the exact content of the original
     XML. Use trim = FALSE to preserve the breaks.

  *  Added xmlInternalTreeParse() which is a simple copy of xmlTreeParse()
      with useInternalNodes defaulting to TRUE, so we get an internal C-level tree.

  *  Added an xpathSApply() function that simplifies the result to a
     vector/matrix, if possible.

  *  Added replaceNode() function which allows one to insert an internal node
     with another one. 

  *  addChildren() has a new at parameter to specify where in the list
     of children to add the new nodes.

  *  newXMLNode(), etc. can compute the document (doc argument) from
     the parent.

  *  The subset operator applied to an XMLInternalDocument  and
     getNodeSubset() and xpathApply() compute the namespaces from the
     top-level of the document by default, so, e.g., doc[["//r:init"]] work.

  *  section parameter added to xmlSource() to allow easy subsetting to
     a particular <section> within a document.

  *  added catalogLoad(), catalogAdd(), catalogClearTable() functions.

  *  Added docName() function for querying the file name or URL of a
     parsed XML document.

  *  RS_XML_createDocFromNode() C routine adds root node
     correctly via xmlAddChild().

  *  Slightly improved identification of HTML content rather than a file or URL name.
 
  * Added a simplify parameter to the xmlNamespaceDefinition()
     function which, if TRUE, returns a character vector giving the
     prefix = URI pairs which can be used directly in xpathApply() and
     getNodeSet().


Version 1.93-1

  *  Method for xmlNamespace with a character is now exported!  Needed for cases that arise in
     SSOAP.

Version 1.93-0

  *  The closeTag() function within an XMLInternalDOM object returned by xmlTree() provides
     support for closing nodes by name or position in the stack of open nodes.

  *  xmlRoot() method for an XMLInternalDOM tree.

  *  Added a parent argument to the constructor functions for internal nodes, e.g. newXMLNode, 
     newXMLPINode, newXMLCDataNode, etc.

  *  doc argument for the constructor functions for internal nodes is now moved from second to third.
     Calling 

  *  Potentially changed the details about creating XML documents and nodes with namespaces. If these
     negatively effect your code, please send me email (duncan@wald.ucdavis.edu).

  *  Enhancements and fixes for creating XML nodes and trees, especially with name spaces.

  *  Many minor changes to catch special cases in working with internal nodes.


Version 1.92-1

  *  Make addNode()/addTag() in XMLInternalDOM work with previously created XML nodes via newXMLNode().
     Thanks to Seth Falcon for pointing out this omission. More improvements in the pipeline for generating
     XML.

  *  addChildren for an XMLInternalNode can be given a list of XMLInternalNodes and/or character strings.

  *  xmlSource() handles r:codeIds better.

Version 1.92-0

  *  Added removeNodes function for unlinking XMLInternalNode objects directly by reference.

  *  xmlRoot() handles empty documents. 

  *  Documentation cleanups.

Version 1.91-1

  *  Remove output about "cleaning"/releasing an internal document pointer.

  *  The warning from getNodeSet/xpathApply about using a prefix for the default namespace
     now has a class/type of condition, specificall "XPathDefaultNamespace".

Version 1.91-0

  *  argument to add a finalizer for an XMLInternalDocument in xmlTreeParse()/htmlTreeParse() when 
     useInternalNodes = TRUE.  If this is set, automatic garbage collection is done which will free
     any sub-nodes. If you want to work with any of these nodes after the top-level tree variable
     has been released, specify addFinalizer = FALSE and explicitly free the document yourself with the
     free() function.

  *  Sme improvements on namespace prefixes in internal nodes. See newXMLNode().

  *  classes for additional XMLInternalNodes (e.g. XMLInternalCDataNode) now exported

  *  removeAttributes() has a .all argument to easily remove all the attributes within a node.
     Supported for both R and internal style nodes.

  *  xmlAttrs<-() function for simply appending attributes to a node.

  *  If xmlTreeParse() is called with asText = FALSE and the file is not found, an error of class
     "FileNotFound" is raised.

  *  [[ opertor for XMLInternalDocument to get the first/only entry in
     the node set from an XPath query.  This is a convenience
     mechansim for accessing the element when there is only one.


Version 1.9-0

  *  Added xmlAncestors() functions for finding chain of parent nodes, and optionally applying a 
     function to each.

  *  xmlDoc() allows one to create a new XML document by copying an existing internal node, allowing
     for work with sub-trees as regular documents, e.g. XPath queries restricted to a subset of the 
     tree.

  *  Ability to do XPath searches on sub-nodes within a document.  getNodeSet() and xpathApply() 
     can now operate on an XMLInternalNode by creating a copy of the node and its sub-nodes into a 
     new document. However, these is memory leak associated with this and you should us xmlDoc()
     to create a new document from the node and then perform the XPath query on that and free the
     document.

Version 1.8-0

  *  Added xinclude argument to xmlTreeParse() and htmlTreeParse() to control whether 
     <xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"> should be resolved and 
     the appropriate nodes inserted and the actual <include> node discarded.

  *  The namespaces argument of getNodeSet() (and implicitly of the [ method for an 
     XMLInternalDocument object) can be a simple prefix name when referring to the 
     default namespace of the document, e.g. 
        getNodeSet(doc, "/r:help/r:keyword", "r")
     when the document has a default namespace.

  *  Added a 'recursive = FALSE' parameter to xmlNamespaceDefinitions() to be able to 
     process all descendant nodes and so fetch the namespace definitions in an entire
     sub-tree.  This can be used as input to getNodeSet(), for example.

  *  as() method for converting an XMLInternalDocument to a node.

  *  xmlNamespaceDefinitions() handles the case where the top-level element
     is not the first node, e.g. when there is a DOCTYPE node and/or a comment.

Version 1.7-3

  *  addChildren() coerces a string to an internal text node before adding the child.
     
Version 1.7-2

  *  Trivial error in free() for XMLInternalDocument objects fixed so the memory is released.

Version 1.7-1

  *  addition to configuration to detect whether the checked field of the xmlEntity structure is present.

Version 1.7-0

      This a quite comprehensive enhancement to the facilities in the XML package. A lot of work on
      the tools for creating or authoring XML from within R were added and improved. Using internal
      nodes directly with newXMLNode() and friends, or using xmlTree() is probably the simplest.
      But xmlHashTree() creates them in R.


  * IMPORTANT:  one can and should use the names .comment, .startElement, .processingInstruction,
     .text, etc. when identifying general element handlers that apply to all elements of a particular type
     in  an XML document rather than to nodes that have a particular name.  This differentiates between
     a handler for a node named, say, text and a handler for all text elements found in the document.
     To use this new approach, call xmlTreeParse() or xmlEventParse() with 
          useDotNames = TRUE
     This will become the default in future releases.

  *  namespaceHandlers() function provided to deal with node handler functions with XML name spaces where
     there may be multiple handlers for the same node name but which are in different XML name spaces.

  *  signature for entityDeclaration function in SAX interface is changed so that the second argument
     identifies the type of entity. Also, to query the value of an entity, the C code calls the 
     getEntity() method of the handlers.

  *  addChildren() & removeChildren() and addAttributes() & removeAttributes() for an existing node allows for 
     post-creation modification of an XML node.

  *  Improved support for name spaces on node attributes.

  *  xmlName<-() methods for internal and R-level XML nodes to change the name of a node.

  *  saveXML() and as(, "character") method for XMLInternalNode objects now to create a text representation of the  
     internal nodes.

  *  xmlTree() allows for creating a top-level node in the call to xmlTree() directly and does not 
     ignore these arguments.

  *  DTD and associated DOCTYPE can be created separately or directly in xmlTree().

  *  xmlTree() now allows the caller to specify the doc object as an argument, including NULL
     for when the nodes do not need to have a document object.

  *  Better support in xmlTree() for namespaces and maintaining a default/active namespace prefix that is to be
     inserted on each subsequent node.

  *  new functions for creating different internal node types - newXMLCDataNode, newXMLPINode, newXMLCommentNode, newXMLDTDNode.

  *  newXMLNode() handles text, using the new newXMLTextNode() and coerce methods.

  *  xmlTree() supports an active/default name space prefix which is used for new nodes.

  *  Resetting the state of the xmlSubstituteEntities variable is handled correctly in the case of an error.



Version 1.6-4

  *  xmlSize() method for an XMLInternalNode.

Version 1.6-3

  *  Handle change from Sys.putenv() to Sys.setenv().

Version 1.6-2

  *  Added a URI (old) class label to the result of parseURI, and exported that class for use in 
     other packages (specifically SSOAP, at present).

  *  For subsetting child nodes by name, there is a new all = FALSE parameter which allows the caller
     to get the first element(s) that matches the name(s), or all of them with, e.g. 
     node["bob", all = TRUE].  This allows us to avoid the equivalent idiom
         node[ names(node) == "bob" ]
     which is complicated when node is the result of an inline computation.

  *  added method for setting names on an XMLNode (names<-.XMLNode), not just for retrieving them.

Version 1.6-1

  *  Added catalogResolve() function for looking up local files and aliases for URIs, and 
     PUBLIC and SYSTEM identifiers, e.g. in DOCTYPE nodes.

  *  saveXML method added for XMLFlatTree. (Identified by Alberto Monteiro.)

  *  Fixed saveXML methods for various classes.

  *  Doctype class:  added validity method, improved coercion to character, and slightly more flexible
     constructor function.  Validates PUBLIC identifier. 

Version 1.6-0

  *  In saveXML() method for XMLInternalDocument, we "support" the encoding argument by passing it to 
     xmlDocDumpFormatMemoryEnc() or xmlSaveFileEnc() in the libxml2 C code.
     We could also use the xmlSave() API of libxml2.

  *  htmlTreeParse() supports an encoding argument, e.g. htmlTreeParse("9003.html", encoding = "UTF-8").
     This allows one to correctly process HTML documents that do not contain their encoding information in the
     <META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=..."/> tag.
     The argument is also present in xmlTreeParse() but currently ignored.

Version 1.5-1

  *  updated documentation for the alias for free method for XMLInternalDocument.

Version 1.5-0

  *  added free() generic function and method for XMLInternalDocument

Version 1.4-2

  *  xmlTreeParse and htmlTreeParse will accept a character vector of length > 1
     and treat it as the contents of the XML stream and so call
     paste(file, collapse = "\n") before parsing.  The asText = TRUE is implied.
     Thanks to Ingo Feinerer for prompting this addition.

Version 1.4-1
	
  *  Fix to ensure a connection is closed in saveXML. Identified by Herve Pages

  *  Update definition and documentation for xmlAttrs to take ... arguments.

Version 1.4-0

  *  Added fullNamespaceInfo parameter for xmlTreeParse() which, if TRUE,
     provides the namespace for each node as a named character vector giving
     the URI of the namespace and the prefix as the element name, i.e. c(prefix = uri)
     The default is FALSE to preserve the earlier behavior. The namespace object
     has a class XMLNamespacePrefix for the old-style, and XMLNamespace for the new 
     style with c(name = uri) form.  
     This information makes comparing namespaces a lot simpler, e.g. in SOAP.


Version 1.3-2
    Mainly fixes for internal nodes.

  *  Export XMLNode, XMLInternalNode, XMLInternalElementNode classes

  *  as() method for XMLInternalNode wasn't recognized properly because
     the classes weren't exported.
     Also, the internal function asRXMLNode() accepts trim and ignoreBlanks
     arguments for cleaning up the XML node text elements that are created.

  *  export coerce methods.

Version 1.3-1

  *  parseURI() sets the port to NA if the value is 0.

Version 1.3-0

  *  The SAX parser now has a branches argument that identifies XML elements
     which are to be built into (internal) nodes and then the sub-tree/node
     is passed to the handler function specified in the element of the branches
     argument.  This mixes the efficient SAX event-driven parsing with the easier
     programming tree-based model, i.e. DOM.

  *  XMLInternalNode objects in R now have extra class information identifying them as
     as regular element, text, CDATA, PI, ...

Version 1.2-0

  *  names() method for XMLInternalNode

  *  [ method for XMLInternalDocument and string using XPath notation.

  *  getNodeSet() has support for default namespaces in the XML document.
     It is available, by default, to the XPath expression with the prefix 'd'.

  *  Exported xmlNamespace() method for XMLInternalNode.

  *  xmlNamespaceDefinitions() made generic (S3) and new method for
     XMLInternalNode class.

Version 1.1-1
 
   *  Change to handling entities in printing of regular R-level XML text nodes 
      created during xmlTreeParse() call. Identified by Ingo Feinerer.

   *  saveXML for an XMLNode object will take a file name and write to the corresponding
      file, overwriting it if it already exists.

Version 1.1-0

  *  xpathApply and getNodeSet take functions to be applied to nodes in a node
     set resulting from an XPath query.

Version 1.0-0

  * Version skipped as it is not a milestone release, just ran out of numbers!

Version 0.99-94
   Changes from Russell Almond and suggestions from Franck Giolat for creating XML in R

  * xmlNode() puts the names on children if omitted. Caller can use names other
    than the XML element name (but this is not necessarily advisable).

  * Added xmlChildren() method to set the children.

  * Printing of an XML node to the console handles empty nodes and text nodes better.

  * xmlTextNode() will replace reserved characters with their entity equivalent, e.g.
    & with &amp; and < with &lt;.  One can specify the entity vector including providing
    an empty one should one want to avoid replacement.

Version 0.99-93
   Changes from Martin Morgan

  *  import normalizePath from utils.

  *  Changes to configure.win to find 3rd party DLLs in bin/ directory, not lib/

Version 0.99-92

  *  Fix for setting DTD entity field uncovered by the strict type checking in R internals.

Version 0.99-91

  *  Added an encoding argument to saveXML(), initially for use in the Sxslt package.

Version 0.99-9

  * Example of using namespaces in getNodeSet()

  * Examples for xmlHashTree().

Version 0.99-8

  * Introduced initial version of flat trees for storing the DOM in a
    non-hierarchical data structure in R.  This allows us to work with
    a mutable tree and to perform certain operations across all the
    nodes more efficiently, i.e. non-recursively.  Importantly, one
    can find the parent node of a given node in the tree which is not
    possible with the list of list approach.  It does mean more
    computation for some common operations, specifically parsing.
    Indeed, it can be 25 times slower for a non-trivial file, i.e. one
    with. However, for a file with 7700 nodes, it still only takes 2
    1/2 seconds.  So there is a trade-off.  While there are a few
    versions in the code, xmlHashTree() is the one to use for speed
    reasons.  xmlFlatListTree() is another and xmlFlatTree() is
    excruciatingly slow. See tests/timings.R for some comparisons.
    xmlGetElementsByTagName and other facilities work on these types
    of trees.

    More functions and methods can and should be provided to work with
    these trees if they turn out to be used in any significant way.

  * add the R attribute 'namespaces' to an XML node's attributes
    vector so that one can differentiate between conflicting attribute
    names with different namespaces.

  * added parseURI() to return the elements of a URI from a string. 


Version 0.99-7

  * Example of reading HTML tables using XPath and internal nodes in bondsTables.R

  * Some additional methods for XMLInternalNode.

Version 0.99-6
 
  * configure does not require the GNU sed, but can use any version of sed now that the
    use of + in the regular expression has been removed. 

Version 0.99-5

  * Added append.XMLNode and append.xmlNode to the exported symbols from the NAMESPACE 
    file.

Version 0.99-4

  * Fix for addComment() in xmlOutputDOM().

  * Removed all the compilation warnings about interchanging xmlChar* and char*.

Version 0.99-3

  * Added support in print methods for XML objects for indent = FALSE,
    and tagSeparator, which defaults to "\n".  These can be used to print
    a faithful representation of an original XML document, but only when
    used in combination with 
         xmlTreeParse( skipBlanks = FALSE, trim = FALSE)

Version 0.99-2
 
  * Problems compiling with libxml2-2.5.11 and libxml2-2.6.{1,2}, so 
    we now test for a recent version of libxml. The test uses sed -r
    which may cause problems. If one really wants to avoid the tests
    set the environment variable FORCE_XML2 to any value before running
    R CMD INSTALL XML.

  * Documentation for getNodeSet() didn't refer to the new namespaces argument.


Version 0.99-1

  * getNodeSet() takes a namespaces argument which is named character vector of 
    prefix = URI pairs of namespaces used in the XPath expression.
 
  * Handlers for xmlEventParse() can include startDocument and endDocument elements
    to catch those particular events. Useful for closing connections and general cleanup,
    especially in the "pull" data source, i.e. connections or functions.

  * xmlEventParse() when called with a function as the data source now doesn't have 
    a new line appended to each string returned to the parser by the function.

  * Passing a connection to xmlEventParse() now uses a regular R function to call
    readLines(con, 1) and no longer does this via C code to call readLines().

  * Fix to the example in xmlEventParse() using the state variable.

Version 0.99-0

  * Implementation for the endElement in the xmlEventParse() for saxVersion == 2.

  * In xmlEventParse( , saxVersion = 2), the namespaces come as a named vector
    in the fourth argument.

Version 0.98-1

  * Messages from errors are now more informative. Using saxVersion = 2 in xmlEventParse(), you get
    get the line and column information about the error.  

Version 0.98

  * Added saxVersion parameter to xmlEventParse() to control which interface is used at the C level.
    This changes the arguments to the startElement handler, adding the namespace for the 
    element.

  * Added xmlValidity() function to set the value of the default validity action.  This allows us to do the
    setting in the R code. This is currently not exported.

  * Added recursive parameter to xmlElementsByTagName() function. This provides functionality
    similar to getElementsByTagName() in XML parsing APIs for other languages.

  * xmlTreeParse() called with no handlers and useInternalNodes returns a reference to the 
    C-level xmlDocPtr instance.  This is an object of class "XMLInternalDocument". This can be 
    used in much the same way as the regular "XMLDocument" tree returned by xmlTreeParse,
    e.g. xmlRoot, etc.

  * Added getNodeSet() to evaluate XPath expressions on an XMLInternalDocument object.

  * Added a validate parameter to the xmlEventParse() function.


Version 0.97-8

  *  Fix error where CDATA nodes and potentially other types of nodes (without element names) were being 
     omitted from the R tree in a simple call to xmlTreeParse("filename") (i.e. with no handlers).

Version 0.97-7

  *  Documentation updates.

Version 0.97-6

  * useInternalNodes added to xmlTreeParse() and htmlTreeParse(). 
    This allows one to avoid the overhead of converting the contents of nodes to 
    R objects for each handler function call.  Also, can access parents, siblings,
    etc. from within a handler function.

  * Included parameterizations for Windows from Uwe Ligges to aid automated-building
    and finding the libxml DLL at run time.

Version 0.97-5

  * Methods for accessing component of XMLInternalDocument and XMLInternalNode objects,
    e.g. xmlName, xmlNamespace, xmlAttrs, xmlChildren

  * saveXML.XMLInternalDOM now supports specification of a Doctype (see Doctype).
 
  * saveXML uses NextMethod and arguments are transferred.   Identified by Vincent Carey.

  * Suppress warnings from R CMD check.

  * Change of the output file in saveXML() example to avoid  conflict with Microsoft
    Windows use of name con.xml.

Version 0.97-4

  *  Quote URI values in namespace definitions in print.XMLNode.

Version 0.97-3
 
  * Added a method for xmlRoot for HTMLDocument

  *  Changed the maintainer email address.

Version 0.97-2

  *  Added cdata to the collection of functions that are used in the handlers 
     for xmlEventParse().  Omission identified by Jeff Gentry.

  *  Fixed the maintainer email address to duncan@wald.ucdavis.edu

Version 0.97-1

  *  Put the correct S3method declarations in the NAMESPACE.

Version 0.97-0

  *  Using a NAMESPACE for the package

Version 0.96-0

  *  Using libxml2 by default rather than libxml.

  *  Fixed typo. in PACKAGE when initializing the library.

Version 0.95-7

  *  When creating a namespace identifier, if the namespace doesn't have an href, then we put 
     in an <NA> string.

Version 0.95-6
 
  *  Documentation updates for synchronization with the code.

Version 0.95-5

  *  Trivial bug of including extra arguments in call to UseMethod for
     dtdElementValidEntry that generated warnings.

Version 0.95-4

  *  Configuration now tries to find libxml 1, then libxml 2 unless explicitly
     instructed to find libxml 2 via --with-libxml2. So the change is to pick
     up libxml 2 if libxml 1 is not found rather than signal an error.

Version 0.95-3

  *  Remove the need to define xmlParserError. Instead, set the value of the error
     routine/function pointer to our error handler in the different default handlers
     in libxml.  We now initialize these default objects when we load the library.  

  *  When setting the environment variables LIBXML_INCDIR and LIBXML_LIBDIR, one
     needs to specify the -I and -L prefixes for the compiler and linker respectively
     in front of directory names.

  *  Detect whether the routine for xmlHashScan (in libxml2) provides a return value
     or not. This changed in version 2.4.21 of libxml2.

Version 0.95-2

  *  Configuration detects Darwin and handles multiplicity of xmlParserError 
     symbol.

Version 0.95-1

  *  Configuration now supports the specification of the xml-config script
     to use via the environment variable XML_CONFIG or the --with-xml-config
     as in --with-xml-config=xml2-config

  *  Recognize file:/// prefix as URL and not switch to treating file name as
     XML text.

Version 0.95-0

  *  Event-driven parsing (SAX) can take a connection object or a function
     that is called when the parser needs more input. See the documentation 
     for xmlEventParse().

  *  Classes and methods explicitly created during the installation.
     This will cause problems with namespaces until the saving of the image
     model works with namespaces.

Version 0.94-1

  *   Minor change to configuration script to avoid -L-L in specification of
      directory for XML library (libxml).

Version 0.94-0

  *   Use registration of C routines

  *   Added methods for saveXML for XMLNode and XMLOutputStream objects.

Version 0.93-4

  *   replaceEntities argument for xmlEventParse.

  *   S4 SAX methods assigned to the correct database.

Version 0.93-3
 
  *   Correct support for DTDs and namespaces in the internal nodes
      used in xmlTree().  Errors identified by Vincent Carey.
  
Version 0.93-2

  *   Bug in trimming white space discovered by Ott Toomet.

Version 0.93-1

  *   Documentation updates. Included xmlGetAttr.Rd.

Version 0.93-0

  *   Added toString.XMLNode

  *   Fixed the printing of degenerate namespaces in an XML node,
      i.e. the spurious `:'.

Version 0.92-2

  *   Fixed C bug caused by using namespace without a suffix,
      e.g. xmlns="http:...." assumed prefix was present.
      Thanks to David Meyer.
  
Version 0.92-1
  *   Display the namespace definitions when printing an XMLNode object.

  *   New addAttributeNamespaces argument for xmlTreeParse() that controls whether
      namespaces are included in attribute names.

Version 0.92-0

  *   XMLNode class now contains a field for namespace definitions
      The `namespace' field is a character string identifying the prefix's 
      namespace. The `namespaceDefinition' field contains the full definitions
      of each of the namespaces defined within a node.
     
  *   Printing of XLM nodes displays the namespace.

  *   xmlName() takes a `full' argument that controls whether the 
      namespace prefix is prepended to the tag name.

Version 0.91-0

  *  Added a mechanism to the SAX parser to allow a state object
     be passed between the callbacks and returned as the result of
     the parsing. This avoids the need for closures. Also, works
     with S4 classes and the genericSAXHandlers() methods by allowing
     one to write methods for these generic callbacks that dispatch 
     based on the type of the state object.

  *  Fix to make work properly with S4 class system.

Version 0.9-1

  *  Formatting of the help files to avoid long lines
     identified by Ott Toomet

  *  Addition of `ignoreComments' argument for xmlValue()

  *  Date in the DESCRIPTION file corrected (thanks to Doug Bates).

Version 0.9-0

  *  Added addCData() and addPI() to the handlers of the different 
     XMLOutputStream classes.
     Code for XMLInternalDOM (i.e. xmlTree()) from Byron Ellis.

  *  print() method for XMLProcessingInstruction node has the terminating `?'
     as in <?pi-name text ?>.

Version 0.8-2

  * Changes to support libxml2-2.4.21 (specifically the issues with
    the headers and parse error regarding xmlValidCtxt). Thanks to 
    Wolfgang Huber for identifying this.

  * Ignoring R_VERSION now, so dependency is R >= 1.2.0

Version 0.8-1

  * Added an `attrs' argument to the xmlOutputBuffer and xmlTree
    functions for specifying the top-level node.

Version 0.8-0

  * xmlValue() extended to work recursively if a node has
    only one child. 

  * T and F replaced by TRUE and FALSE

Version 0.7-4

  * Support for Windows

Version 0.7-3

  * Documents without <DOCTYPE ..> are handled correctly.

  * Configuration tweak to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to handle the case
    that the user specifies LIBXML_LIBDIR and it is needed to run the 
    version test.

  * Keyword XML changed to IO.

Version 0.7-2

  * Fix for printing XMLNode objects  to handle comments and elements 
    with name "text". Identified by Andrew Schuh.

Version 0.7-1

  * Minor fixes for passing R CMD check.

Version 0.7-0

  * Generating XML trees using internal libxml structures: 
     xmlTree(), newXMLDoc(), newXMLNode(), saveXML().

  * Support parsing HTML (htmlTreeParse()) using DOM.
     Suggestion from Luis Torgo.

  * Additional updates for libxml2, relating to DTDs.

Version 0.6-3

  * Installation using --with-xml2 now attempts to link against libxml2.so
    and the appropriate header files.
